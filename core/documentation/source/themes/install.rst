Install a theme
===============

The process of installing an **existing theme** to a website made with Bancha is very simple.
To **add a new theme**, locate the **/themes** directory and place the new theme folder inside that directory.

In that directory you will find also two pre-installed themes: **/themes/sandbox** and **/themes/teabag**.

Activate a theme
----------------

To activate a theme, open the Bancha administration and go under the **Themes** page.
You will find a table with all the installed themes displayed and two columns for each row: **desktop** and **mobile**. Here you can define a **different theme** for each of these two user-agents.

After selecting a theme, clear the cache (**session+cookie**) of your browser or visit the **/go-desktop** (or /go-mobile) page from your browser and you're done!

Note: you can also change the theme from the Bancha **Settings** page.

Here you can find useful informations about creating a new theme: :doc:`create/index`
