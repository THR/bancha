Upgrading From a Previous Version
#################################

Basically, all the Bancha framework is contained inside the **core** folder.

All the user content (tipically all the custom things of a website) are contained inside the **application** folder. This means that to upgrade Bancha, you just need to replace the core folder with an updated one.

# Download the latest version of Bancha http://getbancha.com
# Unzip the tarball
# Replace the **core** folder
# Replace the **themes/admin** folder
# Log into Bancha and **Clear the cache**

You're done!
