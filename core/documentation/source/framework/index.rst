Bancha has a bunch of **Application programming interfaces** that helps you while programming rich apps/services that read/write a Bancha-powered website. There's also an open-source **iOS app** currently under development by the Bancha team (you can find it on `GitHub <https://github.com/squallstar/bancha-ios-app>`_).
