Numeric fields
==============

Similar to the **text** fields, this field let you enter some text but is limited to numbers. On latest HTML5 compatible browsers, an increment/decrement switch will also appears.

Simple usage::

    <field id="year">
        <type>number</type>
        <description>Year</description>
        <rules>max_length[2]</rules>
    </field>
