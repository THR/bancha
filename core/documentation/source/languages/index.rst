BANCHA is multi-languages ready: it can manage any number of languages on a single website, so you can create different (and localizated) websites under the same application.

All content types schemes, have a **lang** field that decides the language of each record you create. When extracting records, Bancha will automatically gets the records regarding of the current language, so this process is totally hidden and automatized.

Each language, has also an homepage: basically it's a page record, with the view template set to **home**. You can decide the homepage of each language by the **Manage >> settings** view.
