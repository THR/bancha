HOW TO INSTALL BANCHA

 -  If you encounter any problem, please refer to the official documentation found here:
    http://docs.getbancha.com


 1. Before all, choose your environment in the /index.php file between development, testing and production.
    The default environment is set to "development".

 2. Now, configure your base url here: application/config/config.php
    If you leave it blank, the application tries to guess it.

 3. Sets the database configuration parameters here: application/config/database.php

 4. Go through your browser to http://<yourwebsitename>/admin/install

 5. Choose your install type between "Default" and "Minimal".
 	The Default, will create and configures the "Blog" and "Comments" content types for you.

 6. You're done! The install script will create a content type named "Menu" which is
 	linked to the page tree of your website.
