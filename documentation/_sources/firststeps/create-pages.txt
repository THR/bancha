Create some pages
#################

By default, the pages of the website are linked to the content type named **Menu**.
You can change this behaviour adding an array of types to your config file **application/config/website.php**, listing one or more content type to use as website pages

    $config['default_tree_types'] = array('Menu');

Tipically you just need a single content type, so let's go on.

On the right upper side of the list you will see the **Create new page** button. Let's create a new page!
